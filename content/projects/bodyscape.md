Bodyscape is a 3D printed fashion piece by Behnaz Farahi whose form is generated from langer lines, sparing the otherwise brittle material from forces of the modelâ€™s movement. It features lights that move along the body in response to torso movement by using hidden accelerometers, a fingernail-sized microcomputer, and special circuitry to reduce form factor and power.I wrote the software for this piece as well as maintenance and safety code for Caress of the Gaze, which includes bespoke pneumatic systems, and Synapse which uses an EMG based brain computer interface.

I wrote the software for this piece as well as maintenance and safety code for Caress of the Gaze, which includes bespoke pneumatic systems, and Synapse which uses an EMG based brain computer interface. Unique constraints for wearable software include low computational power, using temperature and pressure readings to regulate model safety, and bluetooth communication for remote operation.
