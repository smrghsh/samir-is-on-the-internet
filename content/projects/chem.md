Chem Reality is a WebXR demo created at [Vision Dev Camp 2024](https://visiondevcamp.org/) that allows a user to browse 3D structures of molecules from an Apple Vision Pro and Meta Quest 3.

It uses Three.js to render molecules and displays a ChatGPT generated description of the molecule. A user can use simple hand gestures to navigate between molecules. The intent was to explore how spatial computing could be used in chemistry education. The project won a Best WebXR app award.
