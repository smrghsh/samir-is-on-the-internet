Breath Garden is a WebXR based immersive environment linked to breathing exercises integrated with a BCI platform. It was built for the 2021 XR Brain Jam. The flow of a river moves to guided breathing exercises or data from heart rate sensors, hemoencephalography (HEG), or electroencephalography (EEG). I wrote the graphics code for this environment and worked with an interdisciplinary team to design the experience.

Brains@Play is a community-based initiative to proliferate access to BCI technology. They develop a platform that links many different sensors and health devices to front-end JavaScript-based apps for distribution through Chrome-based PWAs. Currently, the team is working on multiplayer functionality. Brains@Play was started with administrative support and funding from the Ahmanson Lab â€“ In the early days of this community, I provided networking expertise and distribution advice, and since then it has garnered contributors beyond the university, gained funding through grants, and created an impactful international competition to encourage ethical BCI use.
