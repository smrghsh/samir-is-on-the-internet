Booksnake lets you explore digitized archival items in the real world. It uses the International Image Interoperability Framework or IIIF, an open framework used by dozens of leading galleries, libraries, and archives, museums around the world to share archival images. Booksnake uses IIIF to download an item's image and metadata, then creates a custom virtual object for you to explore in the real world. During this project, I executed technical aspects of project management, scoping features, designs, and app data architecture.

Booksnake is supported by the [National Endowment for the Humanities](https://www.neh.gov) under a [Digital Humanities Advancement Grant](https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh) (HAA-287859, “Booksnake: Building and Testing an Augmented Reality Tool for Embodied Interaction with Existing Digitized Archival Materials”).
