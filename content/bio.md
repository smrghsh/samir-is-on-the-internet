Samir Ghosh is a California-based interface designer and creative coder specializing in virtual reality. As a PhD candidate at the Social Emotional Technology Lab at UC Santa Cruz, he researches collaborative VR tools for scientific sensemaking, exploring how groups engage with complex data for topics such as wildfire mitigation and marine science. Outside of research, he leads the Creative Code Collective and collaborates on interactive art installations and experimental media.

Previously, he was the Assistant Director of the Ahmanson Lab at the University of Southern California, where he contributed to impactful AR/VR projects in the humanities with institutions such as the Library of Congress, The Vatican, the California Science Center, and The Huntington.
