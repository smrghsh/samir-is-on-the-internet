      <h1>hello world!</h1>
      <div>
        <p>I am a VR developer and design researcher pursuing a PhD, advised by Katherine Isbister at the Social Emotional Technology Lab at University of California, Santa Cruz.</p>
        <p>I believe that virtual reality and spatial computing should empower us to overcome difficult existential problems such as climate change and health. Supported by the Sloan Foundation grant, I am on a project to research multi-user applications for scientific sensemaking, like making VR simulations for wildfire evacuation specialists.</p>
        <p>In the evenings, I serve as a community leader for the Creative Code Collective, contribute actively as a collaborator in the arts, and participate in movement communities.</p>
