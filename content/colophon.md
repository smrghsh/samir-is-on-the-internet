This website is typeset in two modes, a dark mode, and a light mode. Use the toggle at the top right of the website!

This website uses the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) (with the browserâ€™s sans-serif font as a backup), and is intended to be legible on a variety of 2D devices. 

Dark mode's colors are inspired by the default dark mode of [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a software with which I keep a digital [Zettlekasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten). I appreciate they use a mix of greys to reduce contrast, contain enough saliency to distinguish interactable elements.

Light mode's colors are---- (TODO)

The [source code](https://github.com/smrghsh/samir-is-on-the-internet) is viewable on GitHub, it includes [Three.js](https://threejs-journey.com/) for the generative shader graphic on the home page, and uses Vue.js + Vite via [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) for a content management system and build tooling. The site is hosted with Cloudflare Pages. (Thank you for the configuration help, [Leo](https://github.com/TheInnerParty)!)

I intend for this version of the website to do the following:
- Conveniently share information (CV, bio, links) that others may be trying to find
- Express myself through design and the generative graphic on the front page
- Keep my web development skills sharp because frameworks are always changing
<!-- - Display a selection of my projects, and be extendable to future work -->
