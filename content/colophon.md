This website uses the [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter) (with the browserâ€™s sans-serif font as a backup), and is intended to be legible on a variety of 2D devices. 

The [source code](https://github.com/smrghsh/samir-is-on-the-internet) is viewable on GitHub, it includes [Three.js](https://threejs-journey.com/) for the generative shader graphic on the home page, and uses Vue.js + Vite via [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com/) for a content management system and build tooling. The site is hosted with GitHub Pages.

I intend for this version of the website to do the following:
- Conveniently share information (CV, bio, links) that others may be trying to find
- Express myself through design and the generative graphic on the front page
- Keep my web development skills sharp because frameworks are always changing!
<!-- - Display a selection of my projects, and be extendable to future work -->
