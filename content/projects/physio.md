</div>

For [PhysioCHI '24](https://www.hcilab.org/physiochi24/cfp/), our team explored how passthrough head mounted displays could let us use physiological signals to enhance collocated movements. We wrote about how these interfaces may change for one-to-one, one-to-many, and mutual training circumstances.
