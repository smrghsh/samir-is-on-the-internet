As part of an experiment to put acrobatic and martial arts movement inside VR, Danny Andreev from [Sunburn Schematics](https://sunburnschematics.com/) created a 3D mesh of my body using photogrammetry and post-processing tools, and I used Mixamo to rig and animate capoeira movements. The ultimate goal is to be able to fight, dance, and play with this avatar using complex, expressive kicks, spins, and dodges.
