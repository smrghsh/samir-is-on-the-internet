I am a VR developer and design researcher pursuing a PhD, advised by Katherine Isbister at the [SET Lab](https://setlab.soe.ucsc.edu/about/) at University of California, Santa Cruz.

I believe that virtual reality and spatial computing should empower us to overcome difficult existential problems such as climate change. On a project supported by a [Sloan Foundation grant](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/10437), I research multi-user applications for scientific sensemaking, like making VR simulations for wildfire evacuation specialists.

Outside of research, I serve as a community leader for the [Creative Code Collective](https://creativecodecollective.github.io/), contribute actively as a collaborator in the arts, and participate in movement communities.

I am open to chat about academic collaboration or work opportunities involved with cutting edge XR or 3D scientific visualization. Reach me at <a href="mailto:hello@samir.tech">hello@samir.tech</a>
