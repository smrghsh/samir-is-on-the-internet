My first generative art piece! Airbending was an installation piece displaying a particle swarm controlled by a viewer’s arm movements.

A hacked Kinect was used to take a 3D image of the viewer. Algorithms localized the position and movement of the arm and used it to swirl projected particles. The color scheme and movement was created using a mathematical color palette, Perlin noise wind, and Reynold’s boid movement.
