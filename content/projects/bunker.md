Bunker Hill VR is a VR recreation of 1930s Downtown Los Angeles by the [Ahmanson Lab](https://polymathic.usc.edu/ahmanson-lab/).  Architectural and humanities scholars created 3D assets from historical photographs and civil engineering schematics to create web, desktop, and VR applications. We collaborated with many institutions such as the Los Angeles City Archives, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, the Library of Congress, the Getty, and the Huntington Library.

The project was built in Unity and involved aerial viewpoints, first person viewpoints, and even a car driving mode!
