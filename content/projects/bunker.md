Bunker Hill VR is a VR recreation of 1930s Downtown Los Angeles. As a VR developer, I worked with architectural and humanities scholars across institutions to create 3D assets from historical photographs and civil engineering schematics to create web, desktop, and VR applications. We benefited from collaborations with many institutions such as the Los Angeles City Archives, the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles, the Library of Congress, the Getty, and the Huntington Library.
